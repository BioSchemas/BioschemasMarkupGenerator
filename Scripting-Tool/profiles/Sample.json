Some of these properties are existing standard schema.org properties, others require Bioschemas extensions. Table 1 outlines the minimal set of properties for the \u2018Sample\u2019 concept and Table 2 shows our recommendations for use of the \u2018PropertyValue\u2019 concept to markup additional characteristics of a sample described within a sample page. We also propose a new concept, \u2018Biomedical Code\u2019, which is a generalisation of the existing \u2018Medical Code\u2019 concept defined in the health-lifesci.schema.org extension.",
